Done so far:
- Migrated from react router to next.js based routing
- setup supabase client and server
- tested supabase connection to the frontend


TODO:
- create new expense entry page
- create schema file of supabase for reference
- post api call to supabase for new expense entry
- populate sub categories in supabase
- analytics page with most looked aat data charts


UX:
- ease of entering expense details during expense entry (need to research on this)
  - keep the expense addition as minimalistic as possible
- clean up duplicate elements

v2:
- filter based query and analystics chart generation using supabase
